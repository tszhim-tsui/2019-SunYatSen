# Agenda


1. Background
  - Data source?
  - Why study?
--
2. Methods
--
3. Analysis
  - vs contemporary Hong Kong Cantonese (Luke & Kwong 2015)

# Background

Sun Yat-sen in 1924 (from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sun_Yat-sen_1924_Guangzhou.jpg))






---
# Background
## Sun Yat-sen

- 孫文 / 孫中山 / 孫逸仙 (1866 - 1925)

- Identified with the 1911 Xinhai revolution that toppled Qing&nbsp;Dynasty (1644-1911)

- Three Principles of the People:
  - Nationalism 民族, democracy 民權, <br>livelihood of the people 民生

- "Father of the Nation"
  - 1st leader of Kuomintang, <br> 1st president of the Republic&nbsp;of&nbsp;China

# Background
## Sun Yat-sen's linguistic background

|Age|Where|Varieties|
|:---|:---|:---|
|1866-1879&nbsp; &nbsp;|Xiangshan County (香山縣)&nbsp; &nbsp;|Zhongshan Cantonese|
--
|1879-1883 |Honolulu, Kingdom <br>of Hawaiʻi|English<br>Zhongshan Cantonese|
--
|1879-1883 |Hong Kong, Guangzhou, <br>Macau|(Old) Standard Cantonese<br>Zhongshan Cantonese|
--
|Later|Japan, Europe, N. America, <br>SE. Asia|???|






---
# Background
## National linguistic background (Chen 1999)

- 1911: Act of approaches to the unification of the national language <br>(統一國語方法案)
  - Based on the Beijing variety

--

- 1912-1913: <br>Commission for Unifying Reading Pronunciation (讀音統一會)

--

- 1919: <br>National Pronunciation Dictionary (國音字典)

--

So it's likely that Dr. Sun knows some "Standard Spoken Chinese" / Mandarin

# Background

## Sun Yat-sen's 1924 speech

- Data source

- May 30th, 1924, by Shanghai's *China Evening Post*

--

- Two speeches: <br>Mandarin & Cantonese

--

- Topic: <br>National salvation

--

- Audience for the Cantonese speech: <br>Broad, Cantonese-speaking audience, within China and overseas











---

# Methods

Previous studies focused on Dr. Sun's phonology:
- On then-ongoing sound changes (Cheng 2011)
- On influence from various Chinese varieties <br>(Chan 2016, 2017, 2019)

--

## Current research questions

### Q1: Was Dr. Sun's word choice influenced by various Chinese varieties?

### Q2: How is his word choice from 1924 different from contemporary Cantonese?

--

→ Insights to differences between Old and Contemporary Cantonese, as well as the cultural/political backdrop



---

# Methods

HKCanCor (Luke & Kwong 2015) as the baseline...
- 30 hours of recordings of Hong Kong Cantonese
- mainly from around 1997 and 1988
- Conversations in lab recording sessions + radio chat shows

--

...assessed via PyCantonese, in CHAT format (Lee 2015):

    *XXA:	喂 遲 啲 去 唔 去 旅行 啊 ?
    %mor:	e|wai3 a|ci4 u|di1 v|heoi3 d|m4 v|heoi3 vn|leoi5hang4 y|aa3 ?

    *XXA:	你 老公 有冇 平 機票 啊 ?
    %mor:	r|nei5 n|lou5gung1 v1|jau5mou5 a|peng4 n|gei1piu3 y|aa3 ?






---
# Methods

Dr. Sun's 1924 speech manually segmented, transcribed, loaded into PyCantonese:

    *SUN:	我哋 大家 係 中國人 ，
    %mor:	r|ngo5dei6 r|daai6gaa1 v|hai6 nz|zung1gwok3jan4 ,

    *SUN:	知道 唔知道 呢 ？
    %mor:	v|zi1dou3 v|m4zi1dou3 y|ne1 ?



---
# Methods

Compared relative frequency of words:

$$\text{Relative frequency of a target word} = \frac{\text{num of target words}}{\text{total num of words}}$$

Again, with HKCanCor being baseline...


--

### "Unusual choices of words" =

1. Words that appear in Dr. Sun's speech **5× more than in HKCanCor**?
2. Words that appear in Dr. Sun's speech, but **never in HKCanCor**?

--

### Where did such words come from?









---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that were used 5× more than HKCanCor:

### 1. Identity, "we" vs "them"

- 我哋 "we"
- 大家 "everybody"
- 中國人 "Chinese"
- 中國 "China"
- 國家 "Nation"
- 海外 "overseas"
- 外國人 "foreigner"
- 內地 "inland / mainland China"
- 外國 "foreign country"









---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that were used 5× more than HKCanCor:

### 2. Length of history of Sinitic / "Hua" culture, vs the current national crisis

- 幾千 "thousands"
- 年 "years"
- 今日 "today"
- 後來 "later"
- 時侯 "moment, time"
- 時代 "era"
















---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that were used 5× more than HKCanCor:

### 3. Solutions to the current crisis, to save the country

- 政府 "government"
- 精神 "spirit"
- 贊成 "to concur"
- 方法 "method"
- 救 "to save"
- 危險 "danger"
- 發揮 "to bring out"
- 新 "new"
- 思想 "thoughts, philosophy"







---

# Analysis

## In short, that Dr. Sun emphasized on

1. How **we Chinese**
2. with the **great Chinese culture, facing the the current national crisis**
3. **resolve the situation, and save the country?**

--

## How about words that Dr. Sun used, but do not appear in Contemporary Cantonese?











---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that never appeared in HKCanCor:

### 1. Monosyllabic variants

- 國 "nation"

--

    *SUN:	中國 現在 就 變成 係 世界上 頂貧頂弱 嘅 國 ，

	
Note: In Contemporary Cantonese, only the disyllabic 國家 is used.






---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that never appeared in HKCanCor:

### 2. Perhaps Old(er) Cantonese

- 曉得 "to know" (*contra* 識得/知道)
- 裡頭 "inside" (*contra* 裡面/入面)

Note: Both 曉 and 裡頭 appear in Ball (1888).

---

# Analysis

Note: Both 曉 and 裡頭 appear in Ball (1888).

<img src="links/ball1888-p106-luitau.png" width=70%>











---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that never appeared in HKCanCor:

### 3. Seems to be Standard Chinese

- 現在 "now" (cf. 宜家/現時 in Ball 1888)
--
- 欺負 "to bully" (*contra* 『蝦』)
--
- 看不上...人樣 "not like a human" (cf. 唔 in Ball 1888; Ball only has 不 in opera-like context e.g. 誰不知)
--
- 諸君 "you (<span class="referencesmallcaps">pl</span>)" (*contra* 你哋/大家)
--
- 想想 "to think" (*contra* 諗諗; Ball 1888 uses 想 as “to want”, as in contemporary Cantonese)










---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that never appeared in HKCanCor:

### 4. Creative / literary vocabulary

- 頂富頂強 "wealthiest and strongest"
- 頂貧頂弱 "poorest and weakest"
- 民窮財盡 "destitute people and depleted finance"
- 同心協力 "unitedly and collectively"
- 不日 / 近日 "near future"
- 刻書 "to inscribe (an idea)"

Most are traditional 2-/4-character sets; some are possibly Dr. Sun's own creation. Perhaps to grasp listeners' attention?











---

# Analysis

## (Some) words that never appeared in HKCanCor:

### 5. Other politics-related vocabulary

- 人民 "the people"
- 國事 "national affair"
- 進貢 "to tribute"
- 征服 "to conquer"
- 滿州 "Manchuria"
- 國民 "a national"
- 革命 "revolution"
- 三民主義 "Three Principles of the People"








---

# Conclusion

Differences between Dr. Sun's 1924 speech vs contemporary Cantonese:

- Plenty of political / ideological vocabulary

- Quite close to contemporary Cantonese, yet

  - Some uses of Old(er) Cantonese

  - Some uses of Standard Chinese (perhaps for formality)

  - Some creative / literary vocabulary (perhaps as attention grabber)
